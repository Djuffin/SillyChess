Silly UCI chess engine written in Haskell in attempt to learn this mysterious language.
Chess rules and UCI protocol are implemented more or less decently. 
AI is quite stupid and would loose to practicly everyone older than 4.

I doubt if I will ever come back to it. 
If you're interested in writing chess engine in Haskell, you're welcome to fork and get chess rules
and engine interface for free.
